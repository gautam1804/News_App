The primary objective is to seamlessly integrate Firebase for user authentication and data persistence, creating a dynamic and user-friendly news consumption platform. This News App aims to deliver a personalized news experience, empowering users to create accounts, log in, and tailor their news preferences. By incorporating an open-source news API, we will fetch the latest news articles and present them in a visually engaging and responsive web application.

Personalized news preferences are associated with each user, enhancing their overall experience.

News API Integration:
We will harness the capabilities of an open-source news API (such as newsapi.org) to retrieve up-to-date news articles.
The application will meticulously organize and display these articles in a user-friendly list view, thoughtfully designed for Next.js.

Grid View:
Users have the flexibility to switch between grid view and list view, ensuring a tailored reading experience.
The grid view's UI styling will prioritize user engagement and ease of use.
